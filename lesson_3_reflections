When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Using a remote repository is far more convenient as you can access your repositories
from anywhere away from your own personal devices.  If you are on the move a lot, the
remote repository would be more ideal for keeping your work in a single place so you
have access to the material from any location with internet access.
